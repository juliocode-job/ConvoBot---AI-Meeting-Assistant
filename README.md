## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Transcription & Summarization**: Upload an audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.) to receive a full text transcript and a structured summary with "Key Decisions" and "Action Items".
* **Real-Time Transcription**: Capture live system audio during a meeting and receive a real-time transcript via WebSockets.
* **Collective Memory (Q&A)**: After processing meetings, ask questions in natural language (e.g., "What was the decision on the Q3 budget?") and get answers based on past conversations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
* **AI Models**: OpenAI API (Whisper for transcription, GPT-4o for summarization/Q&A, text-embedding-3-small for embeddings)
* **Database**: ChromaDB (Vector Database for RAG)
* **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets
* **Core Libraries**: LangChain (for text chunking), sounddevice, numpy, scipy
